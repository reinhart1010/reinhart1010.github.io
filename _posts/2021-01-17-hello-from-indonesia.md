Hello from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©

I still can't tell whether I'm a newbie or not, since I have recently helped and trained web development, notably at [Kotakode](kotakode.com) (an Indonesian developer community) and [HIMTI](https://instagram.com/himti_binus) (a student association at [BINUS University](https://binus.ac.id)). However, I'm still learning other types of software engineering including mobile apps, Python (not just for data science), and recently C++ for Arduino.

I'm also involved in several open source projects, especially finding and fixing website problems in [Webcompat.com](https://webcompat.com), as well as doing some translation work for Mozilla, Telegram, and recently ReactOS.

I'm looking forward to share some of the programming and web development tips, as well as to see how would this community to grow and empower each other.

By the way, your posts are great!
