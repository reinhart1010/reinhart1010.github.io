Months after I announced [this upgrade project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Reinhart%20Previano/diary/382393) I'd like to announce that [Transjakarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransJakarta) Corridor 9 has finally become the second (and currently longest) fully-validated route (next after [MRT Jakarta](![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17312341/65846374-ba679d00-e367-11e9-941f-13cb14219633.png) North-South line) in Jakarta, according to [Geofabrik OSM Inspector Tools](https://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=pubtrans_routes).

And that also means I'm closing https://gitlab.com/reinhart1010/osm-transjakarta-v2/issues/9 as fixed.

Similar to the MRT, Corridor 9 routes have been split into two separate relations (to comply with PTV2 schema): [Transjakarta Corridor 9: Pinang Ranti → Pluit (6198079)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/6198079) as well as [Transjakarta Corridor 9: Pluit → Pinang Ranti (10042521)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/10049799).

If you would like to contribute in upgrading process, use the above conventions for route names:

```
Transjakarta Corridor <X>: <Start> → <End>
```

## Corridor 9A
Transjakarta has many corridors (or routes) varying from [buses (BRTs) to microbuses (MikroTrans)](https://www.transjakarta.co.id/peta-rute/). For Corridor 9 we have several route variants such as Corridor 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 9E, 9H, 9K, and 9M. A [forward route of Corridor 9A (PGC 2 → Pluit)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/10049799) is being actively developed, so stay tuned for further updates.
