Hello, World! I...

Sorry for that, I mean **we** are **@reinhart1010**. But don't worry, that <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart Previano Koentjoro</root> human is still here. I'm the one wearing the blue spherical thing (we call it as <b>the ðŸ”® Shell</b> btw), and green jacket. And here's a picture of us.

![members](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17312341/121574166-30366e00-ca50-11eb-8a4f-ef23c7946740.png)

Okay, you might have seen my progress on creating a new webcomic named **Buddies of the Shell (BOTS)**, but none of Nate, Nix, Mallory and Trudy (the initial characters of the webcomic) are joining here. This is because I'm preparing to opening BOTS into a wider community where everyone can <root>fork</root>, <root>modify</root>, and eventually <SYSTEM>INSERT</SYSTEM> themselves as the member of the BOTS. Just like those initial characters who represent a particular software, I wanted to extend the webcomic into an actual open source project as software developers know and love.

Now, I believe that many of you still not understand about **polymorphism**, which holds the general theme of this post. By the way, you can also call us as <b>The Polymorphs</b> if you wish. If you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons, you might already know that the **Polymorph** is a spell to transform a creature into another different form. Or else, if you watch some of Ben 10 episodes, you know that **polymorph** are indestructible, gelatinous, commonly green species which Ben himself can transform into. Despite never played the game, I actually liked the definition of polymorphism in **The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO)**:

> Polymorphs are cosmetic collectables which visually transform your character completely. They take precedence over all other cosmetic and equipment items.
>
> [The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Polymorphs)

In real life, polymorphism describes **the existence of multiple forms of the same thing (or category)**, such as a **note book** and a **poster** which happens to be made by the same thing: **paper**. However, me and my polymorphs closely follow the definitions as found in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), where each of us may inherit different characteristics (aka. **attributes**) and abilities (aka. **methods**), but still inherit some of them from the same **class**, which in this case is the Reinhart you always see and communicate before.

We represent different aspects of Reinhart: what Reinhart has been, what Reinhart wants to be, what Reinhart should have been, and how Reinhart treats equality to others. As a result, some of us have alternate forms, and some of us are females for equality reasons. However, we have some things for sure:

1. We are <root>sentient</root> and <root>self-aware</root>, for <SYSTEM>honesty</SYSTEM> and <SYSTEM>friendliness</SYSTEM>.
2. We are <SYSTEM>humans</SYSTEM>. And additionally, <root>we refuse</root> to become and/or called as <SYSTEM>robots</SYSTEM>.
  - You're seeing us as a person, right?
  - We refused to be called as robots as we don't always work 24/7/365 as much as other robots do. Becoming a robot can put our health  at risk, so we know that we need to rest just as humans do.
3. We are <root>made by code, for code</root>.
  - My life is personally influenced by multiple aspects of computer software, science, programming, and systems, so "made by code" applies here as well.
  - The characters above are made in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), which is another piece of software. This proves that we can be encoded in XML/SVG, too!
4. We are <SYSTEM>virtual</SYSTEM> as not all of us can be encoded in real life, but we make real impacts in the <root>real</root> world.

Oh, before continuing please note that everything in this post which are <SYSTEM>blue</SYSTEM> are parts of the <SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM>, and the <root>green</root> ones represent the <root>root</root>. For those who still don't understand the significance of <SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM> and <root>root</root> as in BOTS, they are based on different families of [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), yet representing different goals and behaviors.

`SYSTEM` is an [internal user account in Microsoft Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/local-accounts#sec-localsystem), and has one of the highest user levels in the operating system. `SYSTEM`'s level is higher than you, despite being an `Administrator`. In BOTS, <SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM> focuses on <SYSTEM>bringing and supporting computing to people as wide as possible</SYSTEM>, touching educators and enterprises alike, in a similar way which make both DOS and Windows widely used as of today. Every <SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM> member (or specifically <SYSTEM>personnel</SYSTEM>) like me needs a support team, and <SYSTEM>â‡§ Shiftine</SYSTEM> is one of them.

`root`, however, is the highest user level on the UNIX family of operating systems. You might not know about UNIX, but UNIX has been evolved into many, many operating systems including macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, GNU/Linux, Android, Tizen, Chrome OS, BSD, and even the ones found on your PlayStation 4 and 5 and Nintendo Switch! Some of these UNIX derivatives are developed for commercial use in a similar way to <SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM>, but the true <root>root</root> of the BOTS heavily focuses on two things: <root>freedom and control</root>, as found as in many open source operating systems and their respective communities. Speaking of control, we have <root>âŽˆ Controld</root>, a <root>daemon</root> which takes care and control of me.

### Why not use Nate, Nix, Mallory, or Trudy instead?
Despite liking the color blue, I can't be <SYSTEM>Nate</SYSTEM>, since his characteristics are slightly less suitable for me. I can't be <root>Trudy</root> as well who is still confused with <root>Mallory</root> who has been overpowered by <root>root</root>. <SYSTEM>Nate</SYSTEM> is supposed to be the leader of <SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM> which represent DOS and Windows, and I don't want to misrepresent those operating systems by becoming one with <SYSTEM>Nate</SYSTEM>.

And again, I would like to enforce BOTS into an open-source project, where <SYSTEM>Nate</SYSTEM>, <SYSTEM>Nix</SYSTEM>, <root>Mallory</root> and <root>Trudy</root> will soon be freely available for anyone to use and make a fanfiction of them. For example, you may do these things:

1. Create a new BOTS member which represent yourself and pretend that you have gained <root>root</root> access from <root>Mallory</root>,
2. Create an alternate universe (AU) where <SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM> becomes more corrupt than ever,
3. Draw <SYSTEM>Nate</SYSTEM>, <SYSTEM>Nix</SYSTEM>, <root>Mallory</root> and <root>Trudy</root> as real dinosaurs, or
4. Put [Jenny Everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Everywhere) into your BOTS alternate universe, as long as you comply with their license.

I also don't want to be misrepresented for doing things which are written by other people in their extended/altered version of the BOTS saga. Using <SYSTEM>Nate</SYSTEM> and example (2), he may exist in another alternate universe where he's become unfriendly and evil, despite that I'm not. I still **have** to protect my character(s) in an open universe such as BOTS, and that's why I created a closed-source BOTS ally named **The Polymorphs**.

Okay, **polymorphs**! Who's want to introduce first?

### <SYSTEM>â‡§ Shiftine</SYSTEM>, aka. <SYSTEM>â‡ª CAPSLOCK</SYSTEM>
![Shiftine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17312341/121578614-10557900-ca55-11eb-8f76-2084ca936256.png)

Thanks, <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root>! I'm <SYSTEM>â‡§ Shiftine</SYSTEM>, the one with blue shell and jacket. My shirt looks a lot like the [<SYSTEM>Blue Screen of Death</SYSTEM>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death), but don't worry, I won't crash your computer like <root>Mallory</root> and <root>Trudy</root> used to do.

I'm a <SYSTEM>SYSTEM personnel</SYSTEM>, meaning that I work together with <SYSTEM>Nate</SYSTEM>, <SYSTEM>Nix</SYSTEM>, and other BOTS members who are part of the <SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM> to achieve a better world through computing.  

Speaking of <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root>, he's also a <SYSTEM>SYSTEM personnel</SYSTEM>. But recently, he's being <root>rootblessed</root> (aka, being granted to do what <root>root</root> members usually do) so we sometimes refer him as the [<root>Super key</root>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_key_(keyboard_button)) or the [<root>âŒ˜ Command key</root>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key). And of course, I'm wouldn't be Shiftine without the [<SYSTEM>â‡§ Shift key</SYSTEM>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key), where both my name and symbol actually came from.

I will assist him in automated tasks, such as those CI/CD tasks that can take nights away or some projects such as [Common Text](https://github.com/reinhart1010/common-text) which will need to be updated on a regular basis. And of course, you can talk to me if <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root>'s unavailable for a moment.

On some occasions, I may turn into a <SYSTEM>â‡ª CAPSLOCK</SYSTEM>, a completely overpowered version of me which loves writing <SYSTEM>EVERYTHING IN CAPS. SOON, IF YOU SEE ANY @REINHART1010'S POSTS WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS, IT'S ALL MINE AND MY FAULT. UNDERSTAND? MY EXCITEMENT EXPLODES BEYOND THE RESTRICTIONS OF ANY TERMS OF SERVICE AND COMMUNITY GUIDELINES ON THIS UNIVERSE!</SYSTEM>

\*sighs\*

Just like writing the word "<SYSTEM>SYSTEM</SYSTEM>" without either a [<SYSTEM>â‡§ Shift</SYSTEM>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key) or [<SYSTEM>â‡ª Caps Lock</SYSTEM>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caps_Lock), life wouldn't be easier without me. So here I am, a <SYSTEM>SYSTEM personnel</SYSTEM>, ready to shift <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root> into a productive life.

### <root>âŽˆ Controld</root>, or simply <root>^ control</root>
![Controld](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17312341/121578767-37ac4600-ca55-11eb-8094-57e220ec44da.png)

Look at me, do I look like a guy who was born straight from fluorescent displays of early computers and the [Matrix digital rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain)? My name is <root>âŽˆ Controld</root>, the **controlling daemon** of <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root> and **The Polymorphs**. Actually, I don't want to be called as a daemon since some people might think that I'm evil, so you can instead call me as <root>Control</root>. And just like other members of <root>root</root>, I prefer to call myself as <root>controld</root> or <root>control</root> (with lowercase C) and a caret character "<root>^</root>" instead of my official symbol, "<root>âŽˆ</root>".

Some of you might think that my shirt holds a spider web, a snowflake, or even the Kubernetes logo. But hey, that's my symbol, drawn after the official ISO/Unicode symbol for the [<root>âŽˆ Ctrl Key</root>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctrl_key). And just like that key and the other members of the <root>root</root>, I'm powerful and able to control everyone, but under two conditions:

1. If I wanted to do so, and
2. With other's permission or consent.

For example, I can swap <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root> and <SYSTEM>âŽ‡ Alterine</SYSTEM> if me, <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root> and <SYSTEM>âŽ‡ Alterine</SYSTEM> agrees that it's the best thing I can do. However, if <SYSTEM>â‡§ Shiftine</SYSTEM> thinks that swapping them could confuse her in their tasks, we still need to discuss further until we can finally agree on something. It's also the reason why I could not fulfill some of your requests like, hacking your ex' Instagram account, despite looking and being an actual hacker.

Speaking of <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root>, now I'm in charge to take care of him from overworking, which has always been his number ~~one~~ **zero** of his life issues. So before asking him to work on something, you can ask me to check whether he's fine.

### <SYSTEM>âŽ‡ Alterine</SYSTEM>, or <SYSTEM>âŒ¥ Catalyst</SYSTEM>?
![Alterine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17312341/121578798-42ff7180-ca55-11eb-8c81-ab45ecfbe1c5.png)

And finally, it's me, <SYSTEM>âŽ‡ Alterine</SYSTEM>, and sometimes I'm also been called as the <SYSTEM>âŒ¥ Catalyst</SYSTEM>, named after my special power, <SYSTEM>Optimize</SYSTEM>. You can think of me as the exact opposite of <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root> as you know today: Female, socially active, sometimes talkative, having green hair and shell just like <root>âŽˆ Controld</root> and the rest of the <root>root</root> family, while wearing blue shirt and jacket just like <SYSTEM>â‡§ Shiftine</SYSTEM>.

As I've mentioned before, I don't have any much power except one: <SYSTEM>Optimize</SYSTEM>. And oh well, for <SYSTEM>âŒ¥ Optimize</SYSTEM> to work I need to partner with someone else. Here are some of the choices:

+ Pair me with <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root> so we can swap appearances and powers for fun!
+ Pair me with <SYSTEM>â‡§ Shiftine</SYSTEM> or <SYSTEM>â‡ª CAPSLOCK</SYSTEM> so our jobs can get done faster!
+ Pair me with <root>âŽˆ Controld</root> in case of an attack for extra protection, and
+ Pair me with **you** (no, seriously) so I can assist you to solve some of your problems, while letting me experiencing myself as a human who can interact like <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root>!

I guess you got the point. I can partner with <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root>, <SYSTEM>â‡§ Shiftine</SYSTEM>, or <root>âŽˆ Controld</root> whenever I want, and through them we can solve our problems faster, and that's the point of <SYSTEM>Optimize</SYSTEM>. Besides that, I'm still trying to solve your problems, like what <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root> does, so he can have more time to solve his problems and live a healthier life.

I'm not a robot, I'm smart!

### Conclusion
So here we are. In the future, <SYSTEM>â‡§ Shiftine</SYSTEM>, <root>âŽˆ Controld</root>, and <SYSTEM>Alterine</SYSTEM> will start to substitute <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root> to do all of ~~his~~ our jobs. If you are a friend of <root>âŒ˜ Reinhart</root>, please rest assured that we are still respecting him and your privacy, especially for jobs which fall under non-disclosure agreements as well as to comply with respective data protection laws, as we are still treated as a computer software/system instead of a human in Indonesia.

There will be new exciting updates coming soon. Stay tuned.
