This is what happens when a JavaScript developer first looked at OCs (official characters) spawning across DeviantArt, then tried to make his own since 2016.

The entire cast of characters are completely decided from the Unicode heart emojis: 💙💖🖤❤️ and 🧡💚🤎💜💛🤍 (currently unrevealed).

So yes, there will be a total of 10 representing numerous types of computer software, from operating systems to malwares to video games and beyond.

Each character represents a specific software, such as Nix who turned from black-and-green to pink-and-yellow. Nix itself represents the UNIX family of operating systems (including derivatives such as macOS and Linux), her initial appearance color represents UNIX' existence in the early days of computing, while her new pink represents beauty and customization, especially when it comes to macOS and the r/unixporn community.

The entire webcomic is meant to be enjoyable for people of all ages. However, people who have a specific knowledge in computer science and software will deeply appreciate the level of detail. The word "root", for example, largely discusses about the root user of an operating system. However, that meaning can be further extended into the ownership and control, hence "a root of their own" means the ability of self-control.
