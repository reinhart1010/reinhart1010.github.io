Remember back in 2017 when a [doge](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge) shows up in a Nightly build for Firefox 57 (aka. the first version of "Firefox Quantum")? **Now it's coming back to Firefox Nightly just because the current firefox logo *kinda sus*!**

An explanation of the change and the 'fox gate' controversy are detailed further on Mozilla's official [The Firefox Frontier](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/the-fox-is-still-in-the-firefox-logo/) and [Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/02/heres-whats-happening-with-the-firefox-nightly-logo/) blog posts. It is also possible that the #firedoge logo returns as a response on recent trends in Dogecoin. This could be a motivation for HODLing ~~Firefox~~ Firedoge as the default browser for millions of users out there.
