## A Wild Cursor Has Appeared!
The cursor is perhaps one of the most important features in [**Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer (WIMP)** interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)) which has been used in desktop computers for years. The good old cursor, popularized by the era of Windows 95, has become one of the common symbols associated with retro computing.

**The cursor represents a multifunctional tool.** A tool to explore, a tool to get things done, a tool for entertainment, a tool to create and design. Even though that the cursor itself might not be relevant to my current field of study, ["Mobile Application and Technology"](https://curriculum.binus.ac.id/program/mobile-application-technology/), smartphones today would become impossible without the help of countless clicks and hovers of the cursor to design, develop, test and promote all the things we love on the smartphone.

The closest thing that resembles this metaphore on mobile phones is **the slider**, probably the "Slide to Unlock" user interface presented on the early days of iPhones. However, this concept has already been taken by the Saudi telecommunications company **stc** [in late 2019](https://www.stc.com.sa/wps/wcm/connect/english/stc/aboutSTC/brand), along with the catchphrase *everything's going forward*.

You might have also seen the cursor in different places, especially in the worlds of animation. The "Animator vs Animation" video series creator, [Alan Becker](https://www.youtube.com/user/noogai89), uses the flaming cursor as the channel profile picture. You can also find several fanarts and animations heavily dedicated to the cursor, including "Mouse Trap" by SoKrispyMedia and even Microsoft.

## Unique, Magical, Personal, and Specialized
**If this cursor concept finally made into the rebrand, what would it look like?** The closest answer to the question which I can show you for now is this.

The idea behind it is to imagine a typical fantasy RPG world, but instead of blades and magic we have flying cursors all around the place. One of the most prominent aspects of these worlds is that people often have different kinds of swords with unique characteristics and abilities.

**When these magical swords are replaced with flying cursors, this means that the cursors should be unique, personal, and specialized.** And in fact, many people do not actually know that these cursors are customisable. Windows users can simply use any `.cur` or `.ani` files to replace their default cursor icons, while users on the Linux world can create a `x-cursor-theme`-compatible cursor theme for use in desktop environments. macOS users do not need to worry, though, as software such as [Mousescape](https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape) are available to change the overall appearance of your cursor.

There are a bunch of custom mouse designs found on the Internet, such as the long-running [RealWorld Graphics Cursor Library](http://www.rw-designer.com/gallery). Here's a current Reinhart logo drawn in <https://cursor.cc>, one of the websites you can visit to create custom cursor icons in 16x16 pixels.

## Conclusion, and why the heck would Reinhart use this for his next rebrand?
The cursor has inspired people to explore, design, and create things, which aligns with the [Empowerment](/posts/2021/02/14/introducing-the-reinhart1010-rebranding-exploration-series.html) and [Regeneration](/posts/2021/02/14/introducing-the-reinhart1010-rebranding-exploration-series.html)principles that should make into the future brand. Additionally, the cursor has been used to improve people's lives and create newer technologies (e.g. touch screens, mobile phones, voice assistance) which could replace the cursor itself.

However, the cursor is **not** the only candidate for the brand. In fact, there are many other interesting things which could draw the inspiration behind the new brand including [cards](https://material.io/components/cards), one of the most essential (and overused) components in user interface designs.

There will be many exciting discoveries on what the future brand would be, so please keep an eye for updates and feedbacks on this site (epecially <https://reinhart1010.github.io/posts/category/rebrand20/>), and possibly through my [Telegram](https://t.me/reinhart1010) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reinhart1010) for polls.

See you soon.
