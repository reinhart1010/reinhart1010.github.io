In 2010-2011, [a Twitter account](https://twitter.com/binusmaya) was created to announce new features and providing support for [BINUSMAYA](https://binusmaya.binus.ac.id), the ~~Learning Management System (LMS)~~ "super app" for BINUS University (students, lecturers, parents, faculty members, everything!), including the download links for their then-official mobile apps for BlackBerry OS 5-7.1 and Android. In 2015, the **Digital-Media Development (DMD) division of BINUS<sup>[A]</sup>** [publishes their early designs](http://dmd.binus.ac.id/2015/06/interface-binus-mobile/) of what could be the [next BINUSMAYA app](www.binus.edu/2016/03/02/binusmaya-kini-hadir-di-mobile-phone-anda/) in 2016 named **BINUS University Mobile**, for both iOS and Android. The current **BINUS Mobile** app (BINUS Mobile for Student/Lecturer/Parent), though, was initially published in 2018. **And the BINUSMAYA mobile app saga continues until today.**

I originally wanted to publish an extended UI and UX review of the current BINUS Mobile app, including how the current designs are compared to the 2016 app of the same name. While finding the Android APK archives of the older app, I spotted another app named **BINUSMAYA** which appears to come from the same developer (BINUS Media and Publishing), in both [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/id/app/binusmaya/id1499309793) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.ac.binus.maya).

## Finally, a worthy opponent of Gojek
The decision to move out from the then-popular "Indonesia Super App" UI design (see below) is a bold move Gojek has taken in 2020. I always create memes about the old Gojek app, version 3.0, since it has inspired other apps including Grab, DANA, LinkAja, and even DKI Jakarta Government's JAKI.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17312341/109171387-517e9180-77b4-11eb-8fc1-bb816f8d118a.png)

The newer (and latest) version of Gojek now sports a unique, distinctive user interface design which confused many existing users at the time of its release. However yes, it's cleaner despite people criticizing that the app "now seems to be designed by the marketing team instead of the product team".

I myself originally doubted, complained, and ranted about the UI and UX (2018) BINUS Mobile app, especially in iOS. The app looks pretty good and consistent in Android, but in iOS versioin you'll see a weird combination of fonts, where the app sports **Helvetica Neue**, **San Fransisco**, **Open Sans**, **Lato**, and even **Times New Roman** on their text labels and fields. By the way, the rant made it through a lecture session of [MOBI6056 - Mobile Creative Design](https://curriculum.binus.ac.id/course/mobi6056/). **So yes, at least one [Mobile Application and Technology](https://curriculum.binus.ac.id/program/mobile-application-technology/) BINUS University student has ranted about a BINUS University mobile app in an actual course at BINUS University teaching about mobile application design.**

The newer, **BINUSMAYA** app finally does not fall into that stereotypical Indonesian "super app" UI/UX design. And for those who are disappointed by the current **BINUS Mobile** app, you'll be more disappointed since the app is **currently only available for BINUS Online Learning (BOL) students and lecturers**. Once you have downloaded the app and signed in into another BINUSMAYA account, you'll be presented into this screen (like Clubhouse, you know).

As the screenshot suggests, this app can be used by both students and lecturers, unlike the current **BINUS Mobile** app which are separately released for Students, Lecturers, and Parents. In my opinion this is a good thing for multiple reasons: shared features (e.g. forums) can be developed more efficiently, and this reduces the possibility of app removals due to being considered as spam on the App Store and Google Play.

> **4.3 Spam**
> 
> Donâ€™t create multiple Bundle IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase. We will reject these apps unless they provide a unique, high-quality experience. Spamming the store may lead to your removal from the Developer Program.

The app mockups on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/id/app/binusmaya/id1499309793) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.ac.binus.maya) listings shows some interesting differences, at least that the **navigation tabs** are now more organized. Finally, the app developer knows that students and lecturers needed to access course-related features such as **Topics**, **Forum**, and **Assignment** more frequently than... oh well, **Knowledge**.

So they did it! **They replaced the "Knowledge" tab in favor of "My Courses",** which features a more integrated version of **Topics**, **Forum**, and **Assignment**. And oh, the **Knowledge** tab I just talked about is just a bunch of articles retrieved from BINUS University's WordPress sites. It is possible for that feature to appear back in this app's home page.

And finally, how does this **BINUSMAYA** app compare to the Gojek's UI and UX design? I feel that some elements of the app are similar with Gojek's, including this mockup which feels somewhat similar to the [**GoPlay**](https://goplay.co.id/) app:

And how the home screen of this new app feels somewhat similar to the "Inbox" and "GoPay" sections of the Gojek app:

That's an overview of **the all-new BINUSMAYA app**. It still has some features you love and hate from the BINUSMAYA website and the BINUS Mobile apps, including the "Server Time" features almost no one has talked about, [somewhat negative reviews](https://twitter.com/search?q=binusmaya error&f=live), and perhaps the infamous **All/Other**, one of the most interesting UX design choices at BINUSMAYA. I personally hope that this new app will be eventually rolled out to more students (Regular and International). However, please avoid spamming the BINUSMAYA server by downloading the new app then spamming Microsoft Account logins from the Sign In button. The BINUSMAYA server is definitely not a senpai whatsoever.
