## A Wild Cursor Has Appeared!
The cursor is perhaps one of the most important features in [**Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer (WIMP)** interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)) which has been used in desktop computers for years. The good old cursor, popularized by the era of Windows 95, has become one of the common symbols associated with retro computing.

## Inspirations from the Internet
**"Mouse Trap", a CGI-based YouTube movie by SoKrispyMedia.**

**stc (Saudi Telecom Company) late 2019 rebrand** - The rebrand is entirely based on **The Slider** (aka. the mobile equivalent of this, The Cursor). Here's a 1-minute video highlighting the all-new Slider.

**[Alan Becker](https://www.youtube.com/user/noogai89)'s YouTube channel.** The legend behind "Animators vs Animation" series.

**<https://cursor.cc>, a tool to create custom mouse cursors.** Here's a current Reinhart logo in 16x16 pixels, which can also be used as a cursor, too!

**[RealWorld Graphics Cursor Library](http://www.rw-designer.com/gallery)** - a website showcasing collections of cursor designs. This site has existed for years, while new cursor theme packs are still being uploaded like [this one](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-set/szubidub-s-glitch-pack) which is entirely based on TikTok.

**Kingdom Hearts** - Imagine Kingdom Hearts with mouse cursors instead of Keyblades.

## Why the heck would Reinhart use a cursor for his next brand?
**The cursor itself is a tool,** a tool to explore, a tool to get things done, a tool for entertainment, a tool to create and design. Even though that the cursor itself might not be relevant to my current field of study, ["Mobile Application and Technology"](https://curriculum.binus.ac.id/program/mobile-application-technology/), smartphones today would become impossible without the help of countless clicks and hovers of the cursor to design, develop, test and promote all the things we love on the smartphone.

However, many people do not actually know that these cursors are customisable. Windows users can simply use any `.cur` or `.ani` files to replace their default cursor icons, while users on the Linux world can create a `x-cursor-theme`-compatible cursor theme for use in desktop environments. macOS users do not need to worry, though, as software such as [Mousescape](https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape) are available to change the overall appearance of your cursor.

**That's why the cursor could be a potential candidate for Reinhart's new brand.** The cursor has inspired people to explore and even create their own cursor, which aligns with the [Empowerment](/posts/2021/02/14/introducing-the-reinhart1010-rebranding-exploration-series.html) principle of the future brand. Additionally, as described earlier, the cursor has been used to improve people's lives and create technologies which could replace the cursor itself, such as touch screens and voice assistants on mobile phones. This also aligns with the [Regeneration](/posts/2021/02/14/introducing-the-reinhart1010-rebranding-exploration-series.html) principle as well!
