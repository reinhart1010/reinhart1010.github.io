It has been a long time since the last post on [@reinhart1010 Rebrand Exploration Series](/posts/2021/02/14/introducing-the-reinhart1010-rebranding-exploration-series.html) was published. **Things are going well, but I decided to update the shade of blue from `#0094FF` to `#0EA5E9`.**

The color change might not be noticeable at first. However, the new color provides more contrast against dark backgrounds, making it more comfortable for Dark Mode users.

The original color will still be used for the current and future branding. Further details about the new color usage will be discussed later.
