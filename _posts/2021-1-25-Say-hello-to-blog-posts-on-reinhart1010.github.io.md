Blog posts are one of the most common features of a personal website, showcasing personal works and interests. Now it's avaliable in reinhart1010.github.io, directly from the home page.

These blog posts are originally scattered across different places, from the [OpenStreetMap User Diaries](https://www.openstreetmap.org/diary) to [Kotakode](https://kotakode.com/blogs) to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reinhart1010) to [@reinhart1010 at BINUSIAN Blog](http://reinhart1010.blog.binusian.org). Yes, that list stil does not mention other (micro)blogging platforms such as [Quora](https://quora.com), [telegra.ph](https://telegra.ph), Telegram channels, and so on. Starting today, my articles from those sites will be migrated and unified in my GitHub repository, https://github.com/reinhart1010/reinhart1010.github.io (Hint: It's powered by Jekyll).

Stay tuned for updates and improvements to this site, as well as how it's done right.
