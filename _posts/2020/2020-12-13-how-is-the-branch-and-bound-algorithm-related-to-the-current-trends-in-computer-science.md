> Branch and Bound algorithm is not a new concept in computer science. It has been here for such a long time (firstly proposed in 1960). With recent advancements in the computer science domain, how can you explain the relation of branch and bound algorithm with the current trend in computer science?

On this post I will **not** explain the mechanism behind the Branch and Bound algorithm, since the question refers to the relationship between the algorithm with the trends of Computer Science.

The "Branch and Bound" can be regarded as one of the popular algorithms used to optimize the common searching process of a tree or a graph. However, the paper explained that the effectiveness of this algorithm depends on two factors, which are the domain of search and the algorithms used for each process (Search, Branch, Prune) ran by the algorithm. This also means that newer algorithms for one or some of these processes could bring a significant change in effectiveness and performance of the entire Branch and Bound algorithm. Noting that the algorithm was originally proposed in 1960, this could reflect that a single algorithm could be refined, refined, and further refined along with the advancement of researches in computer science.

Another example which also reflects the situation is the compression algorithm, where a single text compression method can be further refined by defining the dictionary and the compressed version of the text, which can be further refined by compressing the combination of bits of the original text, rather than remembering the ASCII or Unicode codes for each characters. This compression method can also be refined by defining the data structure of the dictionary, such as the Huffman Tree and Code as explained in the previous topics. Eventually, the Huffman method has been replaced by another compression method which has several advantages compared to the Huffman method. The same refinement process are still happening in the research and study on the field of computer science.

However, choosing the "best" algorithm does **not** mean that the algorithm chosen will be effective for every domain of input, or in this case, graphs and trees which contain the nodes to be searched. This has led into the development of two types of solutions in the development of computer algorithms, colloquially names "general solution" and "specific solution", which are also applied on other fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence.
